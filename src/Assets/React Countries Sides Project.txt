React Countries Sides Project


The intention of this small project is to be a side project to supplement your learning at Wild Code School. This is outside of the curriculum and is not mandatory in any way. It is a mini project that will help you to improve your skills within React.


The purpose of this project is to retrieve a list of countries from the following API:

https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all


The user will then be able to select which country they want and this will update the data rendered to the page.


Level 1 (Return The Countries From The API)
* Before starting setup a create react app to begin the project.
* Return the countries from the following api:
* https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all
* Find a lifecycle method within react in which you can do the api call with.
* Take a look at ajax requests and fetch for the api call.
* Once you have returned the data from the api find a way to save it in the state.
* Once the data is stored within the state,  render each item from the array stored within the state into a select.


Level 2  (Display the data for the selected country)
* When a user selects an option from the dropdown list they should see all of the information about that country rendered to the screen.
* The user should be able to select a different country and the data rendered to the screen should change to match the country within the select.


Level 3  (Delete a Country)
* When a user selects an option from the dropdown list they should see all of the information about that country rendered to the screen with a delete button.
* When the user clicks this delete button it should remove that country from the options.
* This will only work between page refreshes.
